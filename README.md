- **macOS:** Open Finder, go to Applications, and double-click the application to start.
- **Linux:** Use your application menu or run the application from the terminal.

## 💡 Features
- **Generate Synthetic Data:** Create realistic tabular data with just a few clicks.
- **User-friendly Interface:** No technical skills are needed to operate the application.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust settings to meet your data generation needs.
- **Data Privacy:** Learn how VAEs can protect sensitive information while generating data.
- **Explainable AI:** Understand the underlying processes of neural networks with clear visuals and explanations.

## 📚 How It Works
The application uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn patterns in existing datasets. Once trained, it can generate similar data that maintains the statistical characteristics of the original dataset. This means you can create new data without compromising privacy.

You can use this tool for various purposes, including:
- Testing algorithms in data science.
- Simulating data for machine learning models.
- Exploring deep learning concepts.

## 📊 Use Case Examples
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhance your dataset by generating synthetic variations.
- **Training Machine Learning Models:** Use synthetic data for model training and testing.
- **Research Projects:** Explore the capabilities of generative models in academic work.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while downloading or running the application, consider these tips:
1. **Check Your Internet Connection:** Ensure it is stable during download.
2. **Antivirus Settings:** Sometimes, antivirus programs may block the installation. Make sure to allow it.
3. **Reinstall the Application:** If you cannot run it, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
